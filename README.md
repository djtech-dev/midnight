## Install

### I. Compiling (RACCOMENDED)

- `git clone https://github.com/djtech-dev/midnight.git`
- `git submodule init`
- `cargo rustc --release --features=[...] -- -C target-cpu=native`
You need to insert your selected features. (`[]` for a minimalistic experience)

There are two advantages with this method:
- Every single extra feature in Midnight is a Cargo features, so you can choose exactly what will be in your editor and what will be cut off.
- `-- -C target-cpu=native` uses rustc's features for better optimization for your specific hardware

### II. From releases

With the future release of `v1.0.0-rc1` (first public release), the executables will be avaiable in Github Releases.
